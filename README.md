# Fine-Tuning LLM on Mental Health Data

This repository is dedicated to the fine-tuning of the `phi3` language model on the `heliosbrahma/mental_health_chatbot_dataset` to enhance its capabilities in understanding and responding to mental health-related queries.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage the powerful `phi3` model to create a more empathetic and accurate chatbot that can serve as a first line of support for individuals seeking mental health assistance. The `mental_health_chatbot_dataset` provides a robust foundation for training the model to recognize and respond to a wide range of mental health concerns.

## Dataset

The dataset used for fine-tuning is the `heliosbrahma/mental_health_chatbot_dataset`, which contains conversational exchanges related to mental health topics. It is designed to train chatbots to interact in a sensitive and supportive manner.

## Model

The `phi3` model is a state-of-the-art language model known for its deep understanding of context and nuance in natural language. By fine-tuning `phi3` on a specialized dataset, we aim to create a chatbot that can provide meaningful interactions and support.

## Notebook

The `fine-tuning-phi3-on-mentalhealth-dataset.ipynb` notebook contains all the code and documentation for the fine-tuning process. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference steps.
